[Deployed App](https://writersbloc.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary

Writer's Bloc is a platform fo freelance writers to share their samples to be viewed by potential clients. Each writer has their own profile page with name, bio, email, a photo, and a link to a list of their writing samples. The samples page lists each sample that writer has posted and a page for each sample displays the name, type of writing, and the body of the sample.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- React
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- nodemailer
- Rebass
- react-spinners

## In Future Versions

In future versions of the app I plan to implement user authentication to limit editing and deleting capabilities to the creator of the page. I also plan to extend the functionality of my nodemailer server to allow for a contact form on each writer's page that allows potential clients to message them.\
